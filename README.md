### To Start

```
git@github.com:Wuemeli/writeup-frontend.git
cd writeup-frontend
yarn install
yarn start
```

### Design

- Design inspirations and code taken from [Material-Sense](https://alexanmtz.github.io/material-sense/)

### Code Quality

- This was written pretty quickly, so I'm not that proud of some antipatterns I used in repo. I wouldn't use it for inspiration. I'm much prouder of the backend repo than I am of the frontend.
- EDIT EVEN MORE: The DevOps in building this has been much harder than I anticipated. Between the tradeoffs of technical debt on the frontend versus backend, this got the short end of the stick. I'm a bit embarrassed by the code quality here, sorry ...
- I'm not a frontend engineer. Apologies about the size of main.js ... Don't judge me (too hard).

### Open Sourced Backend (Mostly)

- [Python/Django Backend](https://github.com/jeffshek/open)

### File Structure

- I REALLY don't recommend any file layout / naming conventions from this frontend repo. It's still evolving and changing as I think through patterns. There are some parts I'm super embarrassed by.
